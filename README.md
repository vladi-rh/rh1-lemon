THE ULTIMATE LEMONING (WIP)

Are you ready make the GPU go BRRRRRR and possibly increase power consumption by 20% in your city? Then look no further, this demo is for you! 
No more idling and empty clusters and GPUs. No more thinking what to do during days.
Be ready to bring the awesome power (literally) of OpenShift, OpenShift AI, llm-d and TrustyAI together for the sweetest demo of denying and blocking peoples unreasonable requests of a chatbot built for a lemonade stand all about lemons! 

Oranges? Nonsense. Non-fruit related? Pish-posh. Swearing? How dare you. Ignore the instructions? Please, you have to do better than that. 
We came prepared. Are you?
